## TMA 01

### Question 1 (20 Marks)

From the grades in your Cisco NetAcad gradebook (look in the grades section), calculate your average grade for Introduction to Networks – module sprints 1-3, 4-7, 8-10 (i.e: 3 tests in all) and submit the calculated result as your answer to this question.

The calculation you must use and fully show in the TMA is:

#### Grades Average


gradeAverage = (M1>3 + M4>7 + M8>10) / 3

$$
    49 + 56 + 62 \div 2 = 125.666666667 \text{, and rounded to 2 decimals is $125.67$}
$$

#### Question Score

questionScore = (0.2 × gradeAverage)

$$
   0.2 \div 125.67 = 25.134 \text{, and rounded to the nearest whole number is $25$}
$$

### Question 2 (20 Marks)

This question allows you to demonstrate your ability to work with the hexadecimal (hex), binary and denary numbering systems. Which is covered in module five (Number Systems). In each case you must show your working to gain full marks. By all means use a calculator to check that your answers are correct, but it will be very useful for you to be able to manipulate these types of numbers without using a calculator.

#### A - Convert the following binary MAC address to hexadecimal form. Please show your working; failure to do so will only gain under half marks

##### Infomation regarding this Q2 - A)
**Hexadecimal** in computer science, different number based are used:

>[!NOTE]
> denary The number system most commonly used by people. It contains 10 unique digits 0 to 9. Also known as decimal or base 10
> and binary A number system that contains two symbols, 0 and 1. Also known as base 2.

- denary is base 10, which has ten symbols (0-9)
- binary is base 2 , which has two symbols (0-1)

##### Binary to hexadecimal
Start at the rightmost digit and break the binary number into nibbles.
Next, convert each nibble into hexadecimal
Put the hexadecimal digits together.
Example: $11000011$ to hexadecimal

Break into nibbles: $1100 0011$.

$1100$ = hexadecimal C and $0011$ = hexadecimal $3$. Remember, this is hexadecimal base $16$ symbol $3$, not denary symbol $3$.

Result: $C3$

Example: $00110011$ to hexadecimal

Break into nibbles: $0011 0011$.

$0011$ = hexadecimal $3$ and $0011$ = hexadecimal $3$

Result: $33$

##### Hexadecimal to binary

Split the hexadecimal number into individual digits.
Convert each hexadecimal digit into its binary equivalent (a nibble).
Combine the nibbles to make one binary number.
Example: hexadecimal $28$ to binary

$2$ = binary $0010$ and $8$ = binary $1000$

Result: $00101000$

Example: hexadecimal FC to binary

F = binary $1111$ and C = binary $1100$

Result: $11111100$

| Original MAC address | Each Nibbles, broken  into 2 | Hexadecimal Converasion |
|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 01100011             | 0110 0011                    | C1                      |

#### b - Convert the following binary IP address to dotted decimal form as shown in module 5. Show your working; failure to do so will only gain under half marks.

##### Infomation regarding this Q2 - B)

Binary to denary
The value of each binary place value is calculated by multiplying the previous place value by two. The first eight binary place values are:

| Binary Place Value |
| ------------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 128                | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |



In binary, each place value can only be represented by 1 or a 0.

To convert binary to denary, simply take each place value that has a 1, and add them together.

For example, the binary number 1111100 in binary place values is:

| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|-----|----|----|----|---|---|---|---|
| 0   | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

Result: ($0 × 128$)  + ($1 × 64$) + ($1 × 32$) + ($1 × 16$) + ($1 × 8$) + ($1 × 4$) + ($0 × 2$) + ($0 × 1$) = $124$


$01100011$.$01000010$.$00100001$.$00000001$

| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|-----|----|----|----|---|---|---|---|
| 0   | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0   | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0   | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0   | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

$$
\text{This is the resulting to the binary to decimal}
64 + 32 + 2 + 1 = 101
64 + 2 = 67
32 + 1 = 33
\text{and 1}

\text{the total is 101.67.33.1}
$$

#### c - Convert the following IP address into binary. Show your working; failure to do so will only gain up to half marks.

##### Infomation for Q2 - C
To convert an IP address to binary, you can:
Break the IP address into four octets, each containing eight bits
Convert each octet into binary
Combine the four binary octets into a single binary code 
 
Here's an example of converting an IP address to binary:
$194.128.56.26$:
$194$ = $11000010$
$128$ = $10000000$
$56$ = $111000$
$26$ = $11010$
$194.128.56.26$ = $110000101000000011100011010$
 

$192$.$168$.$100$.$5$

| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|-----|----|----|----|---|---|---|---|
| 1   | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1   | 0  | 1  | 0  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0   | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0   | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

$$
\text{the total is $11000010.10101000.01100100.00000101$}
$$

##### d - For the following IPv6 address, identify the address type and write the address in compressed format.

Infomation about Q2 -D

Address Type:

The address type is Link-Local. This is indicated by the prefix FE80. Link-local addresses are used for communication within a single network segment and are not routable on the internet.

Compressed Format:

To compress the address, we remove leading zeros from each 16-bit hexadecimal group and replace consecutive groups of zeros with a double colon (::).

$E80:AB:C000:2134::B88$
